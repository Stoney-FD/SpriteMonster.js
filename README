SmokeMonster.js

What is SmokeMonster?
	SmokeMonster is John Locke, or is he?
	But seriously, SmokeMonster.js is a small graphics library based on DOM

Why SmokeMonster?
	Well, there had to be some kind of nemesis on the island, right?
	But seriously, we here at Freeze Development have been making video games
	for over two centuries and with our...
	But seriously seriously we are working on ElysionWeb, a HTML5 game framwork
	using Canvas, WebGL and SVG/VML with Raphael as its rendering backends.
	So want if you want to use the DOM to put together some small simple game
	you are doomed if you wanted to use ElysionWeb here. Well, "dommed" is such 
 a strong word here. ;)
 
 This is what SmokeMonster was made for:
   It's a tiny web graphics library based on nano.js
 
 You can make quick and simple Javascript games based on DOM. 
 But you should definitely give ElysionWeb a try once it's finished.

 

How is SmokeMonster?
Oh, you wanna see how it's done? Here ya go:
		You don't need to initialize


   var mySprite = new SmokeMonster.Sprite();
   mySprite.loadFromFile("freckles.png");
   mySprite.position.make(50, 50);
   mySprite.draw();

   This will draw mySprite at x: 50 and y: 50.

   SmokeMonster.GUI.drawRect(new SmokeMonster.Rect(10, 10, 300, 300));


This whole SmokeMonster thing was made in just a few days.
There won't probably be much new features after this initial relase, as
we will concentrate our efforts on ElysionWeb. There may be a bug fix release
if users find some nasty bugs.
